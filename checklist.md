**Quick update**
Things we need to do before releasing Iris v1.3.3 and the __V2 Overworld__ pack:

- Add broken nether portals :white_check_mark: 
- Add (more) shipwrecks [in-progress]
- Add igloos :white_check_mark:
- Add pillager towers :white_check_mark: 
- Properly spawn multiple strongholds :white_check_mark: 
- ~~Add functionality to spawners (so they spawn properly) (can't fix unless source is fixed)~~
- ~~Spawn villagers properly when pregenerating (can't fix unless source is fixed)~~

Things we may do:
- Add Ocean Monuments [obtained objects]
- Add Trees with beehives to a separate biome in which bees spawn, becomes a child biome of the birch biome [in-progress]
- Update the way we place regions, biomes and rivers so it's *even* better [in-progress]
- ~~OR spawn these entities with the objects directly. (if that system is added) (won't be in time)~~
- ~~Add Desert Pyramids (not in this release)~~
- Add Mansions [in-progress] (may not be done in time)
- ~~Tweak villager spawns (not in this release)~~

*(I have crossed off a couple things that don't belong here, and some others in an attempt to get this list done this sunday)*
